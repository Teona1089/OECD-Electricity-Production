# OECD-Electricity-Production

The OECD is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

This project contains an analysis on electricity production in the 37 OECD countries and 10 non-OECD economies in 2010-2022.

**The goal for this project was to do the following:**
* Get acquainted with the data
* Clean the data as required for the analysis
* Answer to the following questions:
  * How total electricity production in OECD countries changed over the years 2010-2022?
  * Is electricity production in OECD countries seasonal? How did monthly electricity production changed over time?
  * What are the proportions for different energy sources in the OECD total electricity productions? How did they change over the period 2010-2022?
  * What were the top-5 energy sources in each OECD region in 2022?
  * How did the total low-carbon electricity production in OECD countries change in 2010-2022 period?
  * What is the proportion of low-carbon power generation in OECD regions? How did it change over 2010-2022 period? Did all regions have the same pattern?
  * What are the top-10 countries that produced the largest amount of electricity in 2022? In which OECD regions are they located?
  * For each energy source, which top-5 countries produced the largest amount of electricity in 2022?
  * Is there a correlation between GDP per capita (in current US Dollars) and low-carbon electricity production share?
  * Distribution of low-carbon electricity production share by GDP quartiles.
